# The Pillars

1, Everything is a GAME

- Growth Mindset >< Fixed Mindset
- Growth Mindset: Everything is trainable, everything can be learned. With enough effort and strategy, you can get better at anything. Intelligent can be developed => "I'm not smart enough to do this YET"
- Fixed Mindset: Intelligent is a fixed trait => "I'm not smart enough to do this", avoid challenges, give up when a struggle

- High Locus of Control >< Low Locus of Control
- Control over Life (Locus of Control): Believe we have control over our life, events in our life driven by our own actions
- Low Locus of Control: Blame factors outside of ourselves

- Brain can CHANGE

2, The Feynman Technique

- If you want to know a topic really well, you'll need to be able to teach it, explain it in a simple way, and bring a concept to a basic level
- => Explain a topic to a person with no knowledge

3, Trunk-based knowledge

- Get from the ROOT of the tree before going to the leaves
- => First start with the FUNDAMENTALS, the PRINCIPLES, the WHY

4, Efficiency Trumps Grit

- Being busy just show that you're lack of time management skill
- Efficient learning is not about being the hardest learner, but using the right strategy to learn the right topic in the most optimal way
- It's all about being efficient!
