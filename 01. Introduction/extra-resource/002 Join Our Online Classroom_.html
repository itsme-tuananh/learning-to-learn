In the spirit of keeping the course as useful as possible for you, we are introducing a Discord online classroom&nbsp;where you can:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Introduce yourself&nbsp;<br>- Ask the community questions&nbsp; <br>- Get help with exercises&nbsp;<br>- Meet other students around the world&nbsp; <br>- Keep your goals on track<br>- Learn from each other</strong></p><p>Many students have said this is the best part of the course as you will feel like you are learning in a classroom rather than by yourself in front of&nbsp;a computer. I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to ask questions and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. <strong>The Discord&nbsp;community should give you faster replies to your questions from the community, while learning another valuable tool of a efficient self learner. </strong><br></p><p><strong>To join the group,&nbsp;go </strong><a href="https://discord.gg/kDsZfGc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>to this link here.</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;Once there,&nbsp;you can sign up and click on channels to explore different topics.&nbsp; </strong><br><br>I'll see you inside!<br><br><br>(Thanks to Pavel, a fellow student, for contributing the below icon)</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/9KxUUxt7Vd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW</strong></a></p><p><br></p><figure><img height="215" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2021-03-09_13-54-24-8b2ccf9752b026233a7ebd195d792254.png" width="213"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p>
