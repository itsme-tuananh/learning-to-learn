<p>Heads up, in the next video we will talk about 2 books:<br><br>1. Ultralearning</p><p>2. The first 20 hours<br><br>I mention that they are both written by Josh Kaufman, but Ultralearning is written by Scott H Young. I will link to both books in the next video. Overlearning which we talk about in the next video should be attributed to Scott, not Josh. </p>
