<p>My two favourite tools for creating a roadmap is <a href="https://coggle.it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://coggle.it/</a> and <a href="https://miro.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://miro.com/</a>. Additionally, you can also just get a physical Whiteboard to draw your roadmap. <br><br>However, once you create a diagram and a roadmap, I like to write things down in a notebook and the exact plan of attack. What do I mean by that? Well, in my 20s I taught myself to code, and I created for myself a roadmap. You can actually see the type of roadmap I built right here and get an idea of what I mean:</p><p><strong> </strong><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-in-2020-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-in-2020-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><br></p><p>You will notice 2 key things here:<br>1. I chunked the subjects to the important parts<br>2. I had a clear end goal in mind and a timeline (we will discuss this more in future techniques)</p><p><br>The above points are important for any roadmap that you create for yourself. </p>
