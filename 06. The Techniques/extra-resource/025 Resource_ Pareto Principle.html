<p>Here is an example of how&nbsp;I used the Pareto Principle to create a guide to learn to code and get hired in the shortest amount of time <em>(within 5 months without any prior knowledge of the subject matter)</em>:<br><br><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-in-2020-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-in-2020-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way</a><br><br>If you read the first couple of sections of this article you will see how I used this principle to find the exact 20%. Try to create a guide like this for your next learning journey and spend the up front time finding this critical 20% to get you to 80% of the results. <br><br>Finally, here is an excellent resource that uses the idea of the Pareto Principle to learn any language: <a href="https://mostcommonwords.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mostcommonwords.co/</a></p>
