# The Techniques

1, Pomodoro Technique

- 25(?)min of focus mode, 5(?)min of diffuse mode
- Always start with the most disliked task first

2, Chunk the Subject

- Breaking down a subject and chunk it into something that eventually goes to an autopilot (automatic)
- We can only hold 4 chunks of knowledge in our working memory
- => Divide and Conquer: Breaking a problem into small manageable chunks that can be stored in long-term memory

3, Spaced Repetition

- Overlearning is not good
- The Forgetting Curve
- Combine Spaced Repetition with other Techniques

4, Deliberate Practice

- Avoid easy stuff
- Take on challenging task
- => Daily Deliberate Practice:

  - Set an undistracted focus time
  - Push yourself to the limit of ability, to be uncomfortable. How can I gain a +1 experience point from what I did yesterday
  - Always seek immediate feedback (am I doing the right or wrong thing?)
  - Write everyday progress (what I did today)

5, Create a Roadmap

- What path do I need to take in order to get to where I want to be => Planning
- What is the destination, which topic to learn, which material to use,...
- Roadmap DOESN'T NEED TO BE PERFECT in the first place!

6, Interleaving

- Use different techniques, problems and sessions to learn, variety is important
- Learn from different perspectives
- => Skill Stacking

7, Einstellung

- The brain develops in a way to mechanize the state of the mind
- Rigid mindset: Not willing to accept new ideas
- => Integrative Complexity: Willingness to accept multiple perspectives. Ready to integrate new ideas into knowledge. Willing to accept that maybe we're wrong
- => What is option C?

8, Importance of Community

- Being part of a community is important

9, Habits

- Step to form habits:

  - Cue: Something triggers us to habit mode, autopilot
  - Routine: The ritual after the cue, the response of the brain to the cue
  - Reward: Habits should give something that makes us feel good
  - Belief: Belief that this habit is good for me

- 4 Laws of Behavior Change:

  - Obvious: Habits have to be obvious, and the goal should be clear
  - Easy: Habits have to be easy, as easy as possible
  - Attractive: Habits have to be attractive, and the goal should be attractive
  - Satisfying: Habits have to be satisfying, they should give us reward

- => Technique: Don't break the Chain (Streak)

10, System vs Goals

- There's something we can't control
- Create a system (habit) of action for each day to get to the final goal
- Goals are good for short-term, small and simple tasks (maybe can do in a day)
- Systems are good for long-term goals

11, The Power of the Senses

- Metaphor, Analogy, Visualization, Imagination, Memorable Story => Mind's Eyes
- Use images, diagrams, and infographics to remember things
- Invork as many senses as possible when learning
- Adding emotional elements to study
- Learning complex concepts by using what we've already known

12, Method of Loci

- Create a Memory Palace

13, Pareto Principle

- Find out the most important thing to learn, the least to make everything work, and the most critical skills to get an immediate result,...
- "Is this the best use of my time? Is this the most critical piece of information? What NOT to learn?"
- => Find out the CORE, the LEAST to start, the 20%

14, Parkinson's Law

- Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion
- => Set an achievable deadline for the system and goals

15, Deep Work

- Uninterrupted periods of intense focus, no distraction
- To do deep work:
  - Set a dedicated work space
  - Set an end time
  - Make sure your power-ups are optimal
  - Have an easy starting sequence

16, Stakes and Rewards

- Focus on small rewards
- Stakes are the things that we lose by not learning

17, Concepts vs Facts

- Concepts are more important than facts
- Form concept by connecting different chunks of knowledge
- Concepts are how things work, the answer for the WHY, and how things are related to one another. Fact is just... fact, everyone can google it

18, Test yourself

- Practice, practice, practice! Get your hand dirty!

19, The first 20 hours

- Don't need to master a skill, "good enough" is a lot more valuable than just focusing on mastering one skill
- How to get the most value out in the first 20 hours
- Overlearning: Get more than the requirement
