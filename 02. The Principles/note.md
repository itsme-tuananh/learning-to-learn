# The Principles

1, Learning vs Winning the System

- Thinking to learn new knowledge for the long term instead of just acting to achieve a certain short-term goal

2, What is Success?

- Everyone has their own definition of success

3, The Obstacle

- Have difficulty studying, feeling that you are not good enough? It proves that this is a valuable piece of knowledge

4, The Dip

- Sometimes you have to accept the fact that efforts but not going in the right direction will not bring results, need to be flexible to change the direction accordingly

5, Compound Learning

- Maintaining regular and continuous learning a little every day is more effective than cramming for a short time and then neglecting

6, Failures DON'T count

- People won't remember your past failures, they only care about how you are now

7, Choice vs Chore

- Studying is a choice, not a chore

8, It's all in the Frame

- See difficulties as an opportunity to challenge yourself, step out of your comfort zone, to grow

9, Pareto Principle

- The 80/20 Principle: 80% of Output comes from 20% of Input. Focus on the 20% that bring in the most value instead of aiming for 100% in the first place

10, Skill Stacking

- Instead of trying to be the best in just one area, try to be in the top 10% of the best in a certain set of areas to create a unique Stack with yourself, making yourself stand out

11, Happiness Factors

- Finding the factors that make up happiness every day is the foundation for effective learning

12, Your Productivity Time

- Find out when you are most productive

13, Self-Learning Paradigm

- Find an optimal learning "Framework" for yourself
