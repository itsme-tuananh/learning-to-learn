<p>Along with the worksheets and videos, this course will help you formulate a plan for the next topic you want to learn. Although this isn't mandatory, if you have something you want to learn, or a goal you want to accomplish that involves learning, <strong>try to write it down right now.&nbsp;</strong>You can even go announce it in our<strong> #learning-to-learn</strong> channel on our Discord community. This way you can tailor this framework and learning guideline we will learn in this course to the specific skills that you want to acquire.</p>
