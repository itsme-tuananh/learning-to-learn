<p><strong>What are your 5~7 happiness factors?</strong> Write them down, and try to monitor and check up on them every few months. I usually use a score from 1 to 5 to grade how each of my happiness factors are doing. It's very rare to have all of them at optimum 5, but it is good to monitor and be aware of their levels. <br><br><strong>If you want, please do share your happiness factors in our #learning-to-learn channel on Discord!</strong></p>
